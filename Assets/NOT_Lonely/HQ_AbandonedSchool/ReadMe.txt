Hi!

Thank you for purchasing this package!

IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS:

If the doors doesn't work, please check Console for the help info.


All the help information about the Door script 
you can find in tooltips for almost all variables and properties in the inspector.



NOTE: this pack includes customizible substance materials for the floors, walls and some props.
All the resolutions for this substances have been decreased to 1024 or 512 for the package size optimizing.
You shoud increase them back if you want the same visual quality as in the promo materials.
Also, it's recomended to tweak procedural properties of the substance materials in lower resolution (512 is pretty good) for the more comfortable work.

To achieve the same graphics as in the video demo and screenshots you have to be sure that you:


1. Set your project to Deferred Rendering Path;

2. Set your project Color Space to Linear;

3. Switch your camera to HDR mode (Checkbox in the camera component);

4. Use Post Processing Stack with the preset included (Placed in the DemoScene folder)
